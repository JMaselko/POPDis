Title: Simulating population allele frequencies due to dispersal among populations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jacek Maselko
Maintainer: The package maintainer <Jacek.Maselko@noaa.gov>
Description: The functions contained within this package are used to simulate the changes in allele frequencies among populations. The primary model follows a stochastic process modeled after the Wright-Fisher model where the dispersal of offspring-like propagules is specified with a dispersal matrix.
    Additional features include age structuring, cohort specific selection, as well as beta log likelihood framework for model selection when assessing candidate dispersal models based on an observed matrix of pairwise population Fst values.
